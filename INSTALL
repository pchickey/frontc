Just uncompress the archive :
	$ tar xvfz Frontc-X.X-X.tgz
	
Go in the created directory :
	$ cd Frontc-X.X-X

Start the installation :
	$ make install

As a default, this library and the CMI files will be copied to "/usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/frontc" but you may pass a PREFIX definition to install Frontc in another directory :
	$ make install PREFIX=my_directory
And it will be installed in "my_directory/lib/ocaml/site-lib/frontc".
