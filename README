FrontC fork by Pat Hickey
-------------------------
I'm working on a research project with Professor Chung-chieh Shan which will replace the C preprocessor with an OCAML based code generation system. We think it will be adventageous for a code generator to directly manipulate the C AST. So far I've added support for comments in the pretty printers- in printc, comments are preserved and pretty printed; in ctoxml, comments are pretty printed as XML comments. 

I'm working on support for #include directives so that you don't need to run a file through cpp to have all the type names defined.

Front V3.4
----------

  FrontC is C language front-end. It provides the program in "C Abstract Form",
a tree representation of the original C source. It may be used for many
source works including:
	- compilation,
	- source pre-processing,
	- source beautification,
	- source analysis,
	- and so on.
In the version 3.1, it provides also an XML back-end making easier to transform
the C program using XML tools like XSLT (it was my first goal when I perform
this task).

  FrontC is an OCAML library and is easier to use with this language.
Usually, it is installed in the /usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib where it creates its
own directory.
  For compiling with FrontC, you must have a command like:
	ocamlc -I/usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/frontc ...
  And for linking, it may be:
  	ocamlc unix.cma /usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/frontc.cma ...

  Have fun with it.
